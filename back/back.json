Stevens travelled the country exhibiting at freak shows and managed to break the stigma surrounding women who intervened their bodies with colours and shades.",

The fact that Millie had her own business was an incredible achievement as she forever categorised herself as one of the most prominent female tattoo artists in history.

If today we have a place in tattoo studios, we owe it in part to women who dared to defy the norm in which they only had space to be seen in freakshows for having their whole body tattooed. The leap of these women, two centuries ago into a masculinised and unknown space, will be the gateway for many others who will gradually crack some of the gender norms associated not only with women's aesthetics, but also with their freedom of expression.",
